The game is the standard gameplay template we made in class with no changes. I added audio effects of 4 different kinds.

1. Background music with a basic unity audio function.

2. A toggle sound effect for the ships propulsion.

3. A one shot sound effect for the ship shooting it's lazer.

4. A Sound effect linked to a temporary object for when the meteor is initially destroyed, allowing the sound to finish even though the object no longer exists.
